29/10/2016, 23:41 - Samarth Colg: It must be something like user refers the schedule and then books the ticket.

29/10/2016, 23:41 - rachs: Can take extra relationship n not create tables ?
29/10/2016, 23:41 - Samarth Colg: If schedule is entity or relationship.!

04/11/2016, 21:10 - rachs: Wt do u mean by arrows not straight?
04/11/2016, 21:11 - Samarth Colg: The straight arrows are forming loops and then proceeding towards the entity table

04/11/2016, 22:09 - Samarth Colg: Ask
04/11/2016, 22:10 - rachs: Hey I could have used sqlite only instead of mysql n downloading..

04/11/2016, 22:49 - Samarth Colg: And what a line being straight forward?😂😂😂
04/11/2016, 22:49 - Samarth Colg: Lines will be just straight😂😂
04/11/2016, 22:49 - Samarth Colg: Not straight forward😂
04/11/2016, 22:49 - rachs: That was auto correct
04/11/2016, 22:51 - Samarth Colg: Auto correct gets trained in the way you use it
04/11/2016, 22:51 - Samarth Colg: 😂😂

05/11/2016, 18:08 - Samarth Colg: The tuples
05/11/2016, 18:09 - rachs: I tried shifting to left but didn't work I thought it was not visible only in mine
05/11/2016, 18:09 - Samarth Colg: No.. Code is fine..
05/11/2016, 18:09 - Samarth Colg: I'll ask few people who are better than me in latex
05/11/2016, 18:09 - rachs: Hey extend the preview I think its visible

05/11/2016, 18:11 - Samarth Colg: The thing is
05/11/2016, 18:12 - Samarth Colg: If it's not fixed then let's embed the screenshot of the tables😅
05/11/2016, 18:12 - Samarth Colg: At the end
05/11/2016, 18:13 - rachs: I think that would be better n schema I tried embedding it bt didn't identify the file anyways u have  it na

05/11/2016, 19:11 - Samarth Colg: 😘
05/11/2016, 19:12 - Samarth Colg: Lovely sister!😅
05/11/2016, 20:58 - rachs: Oh is it ?
I was feeling bad that I wasn't helping u at all
05/11/2016, 20:59 - Samarth Colg: 'Help' mostly the only thing which I never expect from anyone under any circumstances. Because if i ask one, I've seen people asking ten as a part of reciprocation😅
05/11/2016, 20:59 - Samarth Colg: Why I liked your partnership was because you didn't act as negative influence.
05/11/2016, 20:59 - rachs: Hmm k
05/11/2016, 21:00 - Samarth Colg: You were like 
'maadana maadana'😅😂
05/11/2016, 21:00 - Samarth Colg: Though it meant 'maadu maadu'😂
05/11/2016, 21:01 - Samarth Colg: And yes.. I've fixed the table overflow issue in the report.
05/11/2016, 21:01 - rachs: If it was java I could have contributed more

05/11/2016, 21:02 - rachs: 🙌🏻
05/11/2016, 21:02 - Samarth Colg: At least I hope, you learnt something new from me

05/11/2016, 21:03 - Samarth Colg: Wow!

05/11/2016, 21:03 - rachs: Thanks
05/11/2016, 21:05 - rachs: I was thinking of preparing for aptitude everyday 
But coding part is only problematic
05/11/2016, 21:06 - Samarth Colg: Nice thought
05/11/2016, 21:06 - Samarth Colg: Coding will improve day by day
05/11/2016, 21:06 - Samarth Colg: Don't worry
05/11/2016, 21:07 - rachs: I attend all these competitions going on in clg 
But wt is the pt wen u dont knw the correct answer  n wer im wrong
05/11/2016, 21:08 - Samarth Colg: May be you don't try to analyse your mistakes
05/11/2016, 21:09 - rachs: I don't even if the attempted answer is rite hw will I analyse my mistakes
05/11/2016, 21:10 - Samarth Colg: 😂😂
05/11/2016, 21:10 - Samarth Colg: I'll give you questions
05/11/2016, 21:10 - Samarth Colg: Try coding them
05/11/2016, 21:10 - rachs: Oki
05/11/2016, 21:10 - Samarth Colg: Write a C program to count the stars in the night sky!
05/11/2016, 21:11 - Samarth Colg: 😂😂😂
05/11/2016, 21:11 - rachs: Run infinite loop
05/11/2016, 21:13 - Samarth Colg: Ends up in segmentation fault
05/11/2016, 21:13 - Samarth Colg: The answer is
05/11/2016, 21:13 - Samarth Colg: Print the string infinite
05/11/2016, 21:13 - Samarth Colg: 😂😂😂
05/11/2016, 21:14 - rachs: But we run infinite loop for menu driven pgm 
For  (;;)
05/11/2016, 21:14 - Samarth Colg: Well.. where is the count being increased?
05/11/2016, 21:14 - Samarth Colg: I need a number right?
05/11/2016, 21:15 - rachs: Oh k
05/11/2016, 21:15 - Samarth Colg: Well.. that question was a troll
05/11/2016, 21:15 - Samarth Colg: You took it seriously😅😂
05/11/2016, 21:15 - Samarth Colg: I'll send you few good questions later
05/11/2016, 21:15 - Samarth Colg: You can try them
05/11/2016, 21:16 - rachs: Ya sure send aaram se
05/11/2016, 21:16 - Samarth Colg: Now I still need to complete the report

05/11/2016, 21:18 - rachs: Ya " " 😜 
Is there anything I can do in report?
05/11/2016, 21:19 - Samarth Colg: Will tell you if needed!
05/11/2016, 21:19 - rachs: 👍🏻
05/11/2016, 21:19 - Samarth Colg: I have that much rights on my sister I guess
05/11/2016, 21:19 - rachs: Yaa
05/11/2016, 21:19 - Samarth Colg: 😅
05/11/2016, 21:20 - Samarth Colg: Chalo bubye
05/11/2016, 21:20 - rachs: Byee
06/11/2016, 02:36 - Samarth Colg: <Media omitted>
06/11/2016, 02:36 - Samarth Colg: Finally! Done with it. Now I shall sleep!!
06/11/2016, 02:36 - Samarth Colg: Go through the project report very well! and search for spelling mistakes!
06/11/2016, 02:38 - Samarth Colg: I have made few spelling mistakes deliberately and you need to point them out compulsorily to show me that you went through thoroughly !! Along with them find if there are other typos too.
06/11/2016, 02:38 - Samarth Colg: and don't share with anyone right away
06/11/2016, 02:38 - Samarth Colg: Good night!
06/11/2016, 14:49 - Samarth Colg: Normal form description was missing. I have updated that too! Go through that also.

And see if anything else is also missing.
06/11/2016, 18:51 - rachs: Hey in guides section add trishila mam n vr  also
06/11/2016, 18:51 - rachs: N I think contact no. Not necessary
06/11/2016, 18:52 - Samarth Colg: Are you sure?
06/11/2016, 18:52 - Samarth Colg: Even I thought so
06/11/2016, 18:52 - Samarth Colg: Let me remove
06/11/2016, 18:52 - rachs: Ya for my lab they r the guide na
06/11/2016, 18:52 - Samarth Colg: 😂
06/11/2016, 18:53 - Samarth Colg: VR is vasantha raghavan right?
06/11/2016, 18:54 - rachs: N in output section "acknowledgement "sounds better i  guess 😅
06/11/2016, 18:54 - rachs: Yes
06/11/2016, 18:55 - Samarth Colg: Yes yes.. I just happened to change it
06/11/2016, 18:55 - Samarth Colg: And even in introduction there was a grammatical error
06/11/2016, 18:55 - rachs: N in last table seat numbers not filled
06/11/2016, 18:55 - Samarth Colg: I changed that too
06/11/2016, 18:56 - Samarth Colg: Did you find any other spelling mistakes or grammatical errors?
06/11/2016, 18:56 - Samarth Colg: I'll update them
06/11/2016, 18:56 - rachs: I've read till there
06/11/2016, 18:56 - rachs: *tables
06/11/2016, 18:57 - Samarth Colg: And hey.. the book tickets table also has class as an attribute
06/11/2016, 18:57 - Samarth Colg: Which must be added
06/11/2016, 18:57 - Samarth Colg: Are you on overleaf right now?
06/11/2016, 18:58 - rachs: Oh k I just added based on screenshot u had
06/11/2016, 18:59 - rachs: N in  implementation intro in 2nd line check out once
06/11/2016, 18:59 - rachs: Yes
06/11/2016, 18:59 - Samarth Colg: I think I added it later for some purpose
06/11/2016, 19:00 - rachs: Screenshots u had sent to prepare schema n er dg
06/11/2016, 19:00 - Samarth Colg: Yo... Changed
06/11/2016, 19:00 - Samarth Colg: Pro cess😅
06/11/2016, 19:03 - rachs: In Uniting testing ,"insert .." if it is one line it would look better na
06/11/2016, 19:04 - Samarth Colg: I'll have to decrease the font size only for that column
06/11/2016, 19:05 - Samarth Colg: Then entire table looks odd I guess
06/11/2016, 19:05 - rachs: Ya
06/11/2016, 19:06 - Samarth Colg: I tried giving a line break
06/11/2016, 19:06 - Samarth Colg: Didn't work😂
06/11/2016, 19:07 - rachs: Just make "checks " in middle n rest "insert " in next line
06/11/2016, 19:08 - Samarth Colg: Didn't get you?
06/11/2016, 19:09 - rachs: Since "checks " word is aligned left rest all words look odd so make align it in centre
06/11/2016, 19:10 - Samarth Colg: Refresh the doc
06/11/2016, 19:10 - Samarth Colg: Now and see
06/11/2016, 19:14 - rachs: Taking time to refresh preview
06/11/2016, 19:15 - Samarth Colg: wait for it! Now those insert, update words are in one single line
06/11/2016, 19:15 - Samarth Colg: i used \hspace{arg} to set it
06/11/2016, 19:15 - rachs: Oh k
06/11/2016, 19:18 - Samarth Colg: I really want to add the word 'dummakka' somewhere in the report
06/11/2016, 19:18 - Samarth Colg: 😅
06/11/2016, 19:19 - Samarth Colg: and i'll do it in populated tables of user!! 😂😂
06/11/2016, 19:20 - rachs: aww so sweet 
U don't have to tell the whole world abt it 🙃
06/11/2016, 19:20 - Samarth Colg: irli please
06/11/2016, 19:21 - Samarth Colg: 😂
06/11/2016, 19:21 - rachs: N that uniting testing still looking kind of odd
06/11/2016, 19:21 - rachs: Oki fine add it
06/11/2016, 19:21 - Samarth Colg: amazing!
06/11/2016, 19:21 - Samarth Colg: I'll look into that table wait
06/11/2016, 19:24 - rachs: Looks good nw
06/11/2016, 19:24 - Samarth Colg: anything to make my sister happy
06/11/2016, 19:24 - Samarth Colg: 😅
06/11/2016, 19:24 - rachs: 😃
06/11/2016, 19:25 - Samarth Colg: next ?
06/11/2016, 19:25 - rachs: That s all I guess
06/11/2016, 19:25 - Samarth Colg: I want this to become best you know ? Teachers must keep this as reference
06/11/2016, 19:25 - Samarth Colg: 😇
06/11/2016, 19:26 - rachs: Bt do u think they won't object on using  html
06/11/2016, 19:28 - Samarth Colg: Remeber.. All you need to say is we have used python flask web framework to do this application. The front-end is inbuilt and not designed by us (though it's we who coded it). Just tell that everything is provided by python. The html files access python variables which is just because of integration of python in webpages.
06/11/2016, 19:28 - rachs: Hmm k
06/11/2016, 19:28 - Samarth Colg: Don't ever take the word html in front of them. Just say Jinja2 templates integrated with flask
06/11/2016, 19:28 - Samarth Colg: that's it
06/11/2016, 19:28 - rachs: 👍🏻
06/11/2016, 19:28 - Samarth Colg: good.
06/11/2016, 19:29 - Samarth Colg: Now come to the top of the document!
06/11/2016, 19:30 - rachs: Done
06/11/2016, 19:30 - Samarth Colg: now start going through every page (superficially with intuition) and start sending page 1 okay, page 2 okay and so on. This is one final round of review.
06/11/2016, 19:30 - Samarth Colg: If you feel some sentence messy, go through it!
06/11/2016, 19:30 - Samarth Colg: I too will do the same
06/11/2016, 19:31 - rachs: Oki
06/11/2016, 19:32 - Samarth Colg: page 1, Table of Content(page 2 and 3) and page 4 good for me!
06/11/2016, 19:32 - rachs: Same here
06/11/2016, 19:33 - Samarth Colg: moving on to page 5 and 6 for introduction section
06/11/2016, 19:34 - Samarth Colg: Well expressed aim,objective and scope! Existing typos and errors eliminated.

09/11/2016, 21:20 - Samarth Colg: He doesn't help you debug your code
09/11/2016, 21:21 - Samarth Colg: Or he doesn't teach what big data is like classroom

13/11/2016, 11:50 - Samarth Colg: That's the beauty of image processing. I'm feeling so happy for simulating something that is used in real time
13/11/2016, 11:51 - rachs: Ya that's really good
13/11/2016, 11:51 - Samarth Colg: This feeling had come to me when I had developed captcha using PHP
13/11/2016, 11:51 - Samarth Colg: In third sem
13/11/2016, 11:51 - rachs: Aha
13/11/2016, 11:52 - Samarth Colg: Right now, I'm feeling so awesome. Just because this logic came to my mind because I have understood everything about an image representation🙃😇😄😃
13/11/2016, 11:52 - rachs: Nice
13/11/2016, 11:52 - Samarth Colg: Anyway.. I had shared this with my juniors. Now I got to answer few of their questions. I'll take a leave

13/11/2016, 16:59 - Samarth Colg: You wish to give a gift?
13/11/2016, 16:59 - Samarth Colg: Surprise?

13/11/2016, 17:00 - rachs: U r busy ? I'm disturbing u k ya?
13/11/2016, 17:00 - Samarth Colg: I actually plan my surprises months before! Suddenly to suggest one it's difficult and I don't know her as a person.
13/11/2016, 17:01 - Samarth Colg: So someone who knows her is a better person to discuss with.
13/11/2016, 17:02 - rachs: Just tell me some ideas na 
Candle light dinner is done
13/11/2016, 17:03 - rachs: She loves flowers I had given bouquet
13/11/2016, 17:03 - rachs: Last time
13/11/2016, 17:04 - Samarth Colg: Right at this time, I'm feeling that you must write a lengthy letter to her expressing her importance to you which she can read when you're not nearby.
13/11/2016, 17:04 - rachs: Usually my quotes make her happy 
Last time that worked out
13/11/2016, 17:05 - Samarth Colg: You write quotes ?? I never knew. "Run, run, run. Doesn't matter if you're fat till the goal is reached!"😂
13/11/2016, 17:06 - rachs: 😏😂
13/11/2016, 17:06 - Samarth Colg: Mixed emotions!
13/11/2016, 17:06 - Samarth Colg: Cool
13/11/2016, 17:07 - rachs: She was so emotional last time after she read my whatsapp status
13/11/2016, 17:07 - Samarth Colg: See.. even if I suggest some idea now. It will be from mind and surprises must be ideas from heart.
13/11/2016, 17:07 - Samarth Colg: So my suggestions right now won't be candid
13/11/2016, 17:08 - rachs: No I got the idea it's gonna be a quote
13/11/2016, 17:09 - Samarth Colg: If you feel it's good
13/11/2016, 17:09 - Samarth Colg: Then go for it
13/11/2016, 17:09 - Samarth Colg: Because I never gave my mom surprises 😂

Only friends and sisters have got many.
13/11/2016, 17:11 - rachs: Aha I had prepared this presentation in power point of her photos n her life journey wen I was small
13/11/2016, 17:11 - Samarth Colg: And yeah if this surprise is a sequel (I.e., if you had given surprise last time too) then give a break.  

Next year, you can plan something good.😅 Do it simple this time.

02/12/2016, 23:57 - Samarth Colg: The word *thanks* is thanking me for that😄
07/12/2016, 21:13 - Samarth Colg: <Media omitted>
07/12/2016, 21:58 - rachs: 😱
07/12/2016, 21:58 - rachs: How was dbms exam?
07/12/2016, 23:48 - Samarth Colg: I have a simple project for you
07/12/2016, 23:48 - Samarth Colg: Visit this
07/12/2016, 23:48 - Samarth Colg: http://documentneed.com
07/12/2016, 23:49 - Samarth Colg: One such thing for our college!
07/12/2016, 23:49 - Samarth Colg: Gagan and Harshavardhan who did that are my juniors.
07/12/2016, 23:49 - Samarth Colg: I'm their mentor!
07/12/2016, 23:51 - Samarth Colg: This is to be done in this vacation!
07/12/2016, 23:54 - rachs: Oh awesome even I was thinking of it but different perspective
07/12/2016, 23:54 - Samarth Colg: Then do it
07/12/2016, 23:54 - rachs: Wt shd I be doing ?
07/12/2016, 23:55 - Samarth Colg: 😂 simulate it fully
07/12/2016, 23:55 - Samarth Colg: It's for you
07/12/2016, 23:55 - Samarth Colg: I'm not doing anything
07/12/2016, 23:55 - Samarth Colg: Ning ondh idea kotte ashte
07/12/2016, 23:55 - rachs: This is the problem I don't know where to start n hesitation to try new things ..
07/12/2016, 23:56 - Samarth Colg: I think I've motivated you enough till date. Now it's beyond my capacity
07/12/2016, 23:56 - Samarth Colg: 😬😬
07/12/2016, 23:57 - rachs: I should create a website or execute it or upload notes by collecting it from different branches
07/12/2016, 23:57 - rachs: I'm motivated all the time just have start the work n finish it off
07/12/2016, 23:58 - Samarth Colg: Yup... You need to do all those things. Besides you must create download links
07/12/2016, 23:58 - Samarth Colg: The challenging part is organizing properly
07/12/2016, 23:58 - Samarth Colg: Work with some team mate
07/12/2016, 23:58 - rachs: Oki nice this sounds cool
07/12/2016, 23:59 - rachs: Suggestions pls for teammate
07/12/2016, 23:59 - Samarth Colg: Anushree and Nisarga
07/12/2016, 23:59 - rachs: Did I tell u started with image processing
07/12/2016, 23:59 - Samarth Colg: Good good
08/12/2016, 00:00 - Samarth Colg: What all did you implement?
08/12/2016, 00:00 - rachs: Oh wow why not unless they let me do the work n not do it all on their own
08/12/2016, 00:00 - Samarth Colg: I shall talk to them and ask to do things as a team!😬
08/12/2016, 00:00 - rachs: Nothing I told i just started trying to know how camera works... just went thru tutorials point
08/12/2016, 00:01 - Samarth Colg: The way you tell..😬😂
I thought you already did something cool
08/12/2016, 00:01 - rachs: Oki pls I know they won't let me do it
08/12/2016, 00:01 - rachs: I told i started I didn't say I implemented
08/12/2016, 00:01 - Samarth Colg: Did I tell you that I coded a ML algorithm that predicts the type of cancer?
08/12/2016, 00:02 - Samarth Colg: For me started -> implemented
08/12/2016, 00:02 - rachs: Oh wow no u didn't tell me
08/12/2016, 00:02 - rachs: Got it
08/12/2016, 00:02 - Samarth Colg: There are few conditions for a cancer being benign or malignant
08/12/2016, 00:03 - Samarth Colg: If you give those conditions, my code will tell you what type is the cancer
08/12/2016, 00:03 - Samarth Colg: With 98℅ accuracy
08/12/2016, 00:03 - rachs: But how do u find out which among those two is ?
08/12/2016, 00:04 - Samarth Colg: I have a dataset which I use to train my algorithm
08/12/2016, 00:05 - rachs: Oki but what if in actual terms finding out which among those two is only difficult..okay I'm thinking too much in real world perspective leave it
08/12/2016, 00:05 - Samarth Colg: My implementation is for real world.
08/12/2016, 00:05 - Samarth Colg: I'll explain in few steps.. Listen
08/12/2016, 00:06 - Samarth Colg: 1. I have a dataset which has the conditions (symptoms or observations) along with its respective class or type of cancer.
08/12/2016, 00:07 - Samarth Colg: 2. I use this to tell my algorithm to understand the conditions of tissues and learn the type of cancer for such conditions
08/12/2016, 00:07 - Samarth Colg: 3. It learns.
08/12/2016, 00:07 - Samarth Colg: 4. Now give the new observed conditions
08/12/2016, 00:07 - rachs: Okay
08/12/2016, 00:08 - Samarth Colg: It verifies from its lessons and gets you the result
08/12/2016, 00:08 - Samarth Colg: I trained my algorithm with 400 observations
08/12/2016, 00:08 - Samarth Colg: Real time observation
08/12/2016, 00:09 - rachs: Oh that's cool I got it I just wanted to know if finding out those two was difficult or not but it can be done by biopsy,tests ..
08/12/2016, 00:10 - Samarth Colg: And later I made it to predict for some more predetermined observations.

Then I compared my predictions with actual value and I got 98℅ accuracy.
08/12/2016, 00:10 - Samarth Colg: Yes.. Those people can use this to cross verify their prediction
08/12/2016, 00:10 - Samarth Colg: 😬
08/12/2016, 00:11 - rachs: How do u train ur algorithm by giving different inputs ?
08/12/2016, 00:11 - Samarth Colg: 😂😂 eh no
08/12/2016, 00:11 - Samarth Colg: By curve fitting
08/12/2016, 00:11 - Samarth Colg: This curve fitting can be linear or multi dimensional
08/12/2016, 00:12 - rachs: This is what happens when u no nothing about machine learning
08/12/2016, 00:12 - Samarth Colg: In my case it was 9 dimensional curve fitting
08/12/2016, 00:12 - rachs: U had told me abt e.g. of flowers types na
08/12/2016, 00:12 - Samarth Colg: I can't actually imagine how a nine dimension looks but I implemented it😅
08/12/2016, 00:12 - Samarth Colg: Exactly
08/12/2016, 00:13 - Samarth Colg: There it was four dimensions
08/12/2016, 00:13 - Samarth Colg: Sepal width and length
Petal width and length
08/12/2016, 00:13 - rachs: Actually I've started liking computer science n I'm mentally preparing myself for ms
08/12/2016, 00:13 - rachs: "MS"
08/12/2016, 00:14 - Samarth Colg: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
08/12/2016, 00:14 - rachs: As expected
08/12/2016, 00:14 - Samarth Colg: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
08/12/2016, 00:15 - rachs: 😅
08/12/2016, 00:15 - Samarth Colg: Made me laugh more
08/12/2016, 00:15 - Samarth Colg: You switch your dreams so quickly😂
08/12/2016, 00:15 - rachs: I know Idk a lot of things but before I enter higher degree I'm gonna make sure that finish learning all these stuff
08/12/2016, 00:16 - Samarth Colg: Because you wanted to do MBA, you said that you took management related elective
08/12/2016, 00:16 - Samarth Colg: Now you are telling you're mentally preparing yourself for MS in some computer domain
08/12/2016, 00:16 - rachs: Little change in plan after MS I'm going for MBA
08/12/2016, 00:16 - Samarth Colg: Be focused!😂
08/12/2016, 00:16 - Samarth Colg: Good Kuch
08/12/2016, 00:16 - Samarth Colg: *luck
08/12/2016, 00:17 - Samarth Colg: By the way..
We are diverted from what we were discussing
08/12/2016, 00:17 - rachs: Till 4th year no guarantee about wt  I'm gonna do
08/12/2016, 00:18 - rachs: Abt machine learning n my silly question related to it
08/12/2016, 00:18 - Samarth Colg: I'm speaking with respect to *document need*
08/12/2016, 00:18 - rachs: Oh k
08/12/2016, 00:19 - Samarth Colg: 🤘🏻
08/12/2016, 00:20 - Samarth Colg: Learn whatever is required nicely and do it. Give me credits as *source of encouragement*😬😅
08/12/2016, 00:20 - rachs: So I shd ... I'll figure out first what all things necessary for it n how to do it 
Planning ..
08/12/2016, 00:20 - rachs: 👍🏻
08/12/2016, 00:20 - Samarth Colg: 😋

You should answer your brother in any condition. 

What made me angry was Suneha asking me not to talk to you. But it's fine. She is tour best friend and she took care of yours 😂

I as a brother of anyone for that matter will be ready to get scoldings from them if that makes them feel good

14/01/2017, 00:12 - Samarth Colg: I'll not let that happen😂
